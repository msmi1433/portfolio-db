# Portfolio Site API

This project provides an API for my portfolio website that interacts with a databse of projects that I have created.

The API allows me to easily access and render my portfolio projects in the front end of my portfolio website.

## Stack

- Express
- Node
- JavaScript
- PSQL

The database is hosted using ElephantSQL, and the API is hosted via Cyclic.sh.

## Endpoints

API endpoints are detailed in the `endpoints.json` file within this repo.
